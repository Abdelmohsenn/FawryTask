🧪 Sample Test Data Overview
The following test setup demonstrates various scenarios using different product types and customer profiles:
Products:
🧀 Cheese: Includes both a valid (not expired) and an expired cheese product.
📺 TV: A high-value item with limited quantity.
📱 Mobile: An expensive smartphone with fractional weight.
🎫 MobileScratchCard: A basic recharge card.
🍪 Biscuit: A low-cost, perishable snack with a valid expiry date.
Customers:
💰 richCustomer: Has a large balance and can afford any product.
🧍‍♂️ poorCustomer: Has minimal balance, likely to trigger InsufficientBalanceException.
🛒 emptyCartCustomer: Starts with an empty cart, used to test edge cases like checking out an empty cart.
These samples are used to simulate normal purchases, expired product handling, insufficient funds, and empty cart scenarios.
